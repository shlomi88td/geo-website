    <h1>ABOUT US</h1><br><br><br><br><br>
    <p>The American Association of Geographers (AAG) is a nonprofit scientific and educational society founded in 1904. For more than 100 years the AAG has contributed to the advancement of geography. Its members from nearly 100 countries share interests in the theory, methods, and practice of geography, which they cultivate through the AAG's Annual Meeting, scholarly journals (Annals of the American Association of Geographers, The Professional Geographer, the AAG Review of Books and GeoHumanities), and the online AAG Newsletter.

The AAG promotes discussion among its members and with scholars in related fields, in part through the activities of its affinity groups and more than 60 specialty groups. The meetings and activities of our regional divisions provide the opportunity to network with colleagues near you.

Who are AAG members?
AAG members are geographers and related professionals who work in the public, private, and academic sectors. They work in a wide range of careers, as community college instructors, federal, state and local government employees, planners, cartographers, scientists, non-profit workers, entrepreneurs, businesspeople, elementary and secondary educators, graduate students, retirees, university administrators, and so on from all over the world.

More than 300 volunteer leaders serve on our AAG Council and our many other committees and groups. You can join the AAG as an individual member or as a corporate organization.</p>
