    <h1>ABOUT GEOGRAPHY</h1>
    
    <p>Geography is GIS
Like virtually every discipline, the practice and study of geography has been fundamentally altered by the digital revolution. Today’s geographers are equipped with sophisticated programs that run on desktops and online. Collectively, these digital mapping and spatial analysis tools are known as GIS, or geographic information systems.</p>
    
    <p>Geography is Science
Science—an endeavor in which someone investigates a question or a problem, using reliable, verifiable methods, and sharing broadly what she or he finds as a result—has always been tied closely to increasing our understanding of the world around us. Geography provides the framework and foundation for enabling many kinds of scientific research.</p>
